                    <li> <strong>Prep Ingredients:</strong> Start by cooking the rice in advance and letting it cool. Cut the chicken into small pieces and chop the vegetables into bite-sized chunks.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Cook Chicken:</strong> Heat some oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until they turn golden brown and are fully cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Saute Vegetables:</strong> In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Stir-fry the minced garlic and ginger for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Then, add the chopped vegetables and stir-fry until they are tender but still crisp.</li><br>

               <h3>Chicken 65 is a popular and spicy South Indian fried chicken dish known for its intense flavors and crispiness. Here's a brief description of the recipe:<h3>
                 
          <h2>List Of Ingredients:</h2>
                 <ul style="list-style:none">
                   <li>Boneless chicken pieces, typically thigh or breast</li><br>                
                   <li>Yogurt</li><br>

                   <li>Turmeric powder</li><br>
                   <li>Red chili powder</li><br>
                   <li>Garam masala</li><br>
                   <li>Curry leaves</li><br>
                   <li>Cornstarch or rice flour</li><br>
                   <li>Lemon juice</li><br>
                   <li>Salt to taste</li><br>
                   <li>Oil for frying</li><br>
                   <li>Red or green chilies (optional, for extra heat)</li><br>
                   
                 </ul>
             <h2>Instructions For Preparation</h2>
           <ol style="list-style:none">
             <li><strong>Marinate Chicken:</strong> Start by marinating the chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Add a squeeze of lemon juice for some tanginess. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or you can refrigerate it for a few hours to enhance the flavors.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Coat with Cornstarch:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine cornstarch or rice flour with a bit of red chili powder and salt. Coat the marinated chicken pieces evenly with this mixture. This will give the chicken its signature crispy texture.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Fry Chicken:</strong> Heat oil in a deep pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the coated chicken pieces, a few at a time, ensuring they don't overcrowd the pan. Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Temper with Curry Leaves:</strong> In the same pan, you can use a bit of the remaining oil to temper with curry leaves and slit red or green chilies for added flavor and aroma. Be cautious, as this can be quite spicy.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Return the fried chicken pieces to the pan and toss them in the tempering mixture. This helps the chicken absorb more flavor.</li><br>
              <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Transfer the Chicken 65 to a serving plate and garnish with additional curry leaves. It's typically served hot and can be a delicious appetizer or side dish.</li><br>
